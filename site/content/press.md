                <p><a href="http://notifica.us">Notifica</a> was born in one of our meetups, where a guest from
                United We Dream shared the idea with the community, and some members decided to start
                work on it.</p>

                <p>Dec 16, 2016 <strong>Latino Usa</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/antoniacere">Antonia Cerejido</a></p>
                <p>No matter the measure, whether it be race, class, or gender, the tech industry
                does not reflect the American work horse. Most industry leaders, including
                Google and Facebook, see the lack of diversity as a problem, and one of the
                most common diagnoses is what is called “the pipeline.” The idea is that there
                aren’t enough qualified candidates from underrepresented groups to hire because
                they aren’t being prepared for careers in tech.</p>

                <p>As more people create Slack groups outside work, social activity is shifting off of Facebook.</p>
