                  We're always looking for partners and sponsors to help move our mission forward!
                  We can help promote your event to a latinx audience, find volunteers for different
                  activities, or design programs together that can benefit the community.
                </p>
                <p>We are looking for speakers, locations for our events, sponsors for programs for our members, food,
                    services and  merchandise,
                  and we're open to other partnering ideas. In return
                  we can provide a spotlight for your organization in our events and networks.</p>
                <p>You can email us at organizers@techqueria.org, or using the contact feature in
                <a href="https://www.meetup.com/techqueria/">Meetup</a></p>
