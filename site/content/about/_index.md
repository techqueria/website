## Who we are

We're a community of Latinxs in tech.

We're a space where Latinxs can network and advance in our careers, work on open-source together, and help workers like us across the industry.

We come from all walks of life and believe that the diversity of our community is the most reliable asset we have.

We promote collaboration among our members and aim to create a culture that advances our individual and collective success.

## What we do

We build Latinx-centered spaces that revolve around career advice, technical talks, mentorship, open jobs, upcoming events/conferences, speaking opportunities, and even where to get great food!

## Our Story

David Silva and Shashi Jain organized the first events at the NextSpace in Berkeley, CA.

We later started hosting at companies across the Bay Area and grew our community thanks to the work of Kimberly Muñoz and CJ Joulain.

LA was the first place we held events outside the Bay Area thanks to the help of Esteban Uribe and Hector Carmona.

As our community moves, we form chapters and support one another in building a home for Latinxs in tech. We welcome all that share our mission!

> If you are interested in starting a chapter, reach out to [organizers@techqueria.org](mailto:organizers@techqueria.org) or [via Slack](/slack/#contact-admins).
