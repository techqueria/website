This slack channel is simply amazing. I was able to land my first job as a
front end developer all thanks to someone introducing me to my employer. It's
nice to see so many latinos of all different ethnicities have each other's
back.

            <h2>Latinos In Tech - Getting beyond the 3% <small>March 28 - Oakland</small></h2>
            <p>
                California—the San Francisco Bay Area in particular—is a global hub for
                high-tech innovation and by 2020 there will be one million high-paying software
                jobs unfilled across the county. Unfortunately, only 54% of Latino families in
                California have internet access at home and only 3% of high-tech industry
                employees are Latino. How can we change this reality?
