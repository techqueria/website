                <h2>Who we are</h2>
                <p>
                    We're a professional community for latinxs in tech. A space where we can network and advance in our careers,
                    bring access to tech for low income communities and increase the opportunities
                    for us in tech.
                </p>
                <p>We come from all walks of life, and believe that the diversity in the community is our strongest asset.
                We promote collaboration between our members, and aim to create a culture where we are constantly looking for
                ways to uplift each other.</p>

                <h2>What we do</h2>
                <p>We maintain online communities to hold conversations around different topics that are valuable for the community;
                career advice, work opportunities, events, resources and even where to get great food!</p>
                <p>We meet for events in our different chapters, usually with speakers or a panel to both learn something new and
                    have the opportunity to network and create stronger bonds.</p>
                <p>We create partnerships with other organizations and communities; both those that provide value to our members
                    or in those that we can volunteer and help them get closer to their goals.</p>
