# Code of Conduct

Latinxs in tech is a professional space for all members of our growing community. We believe in respect, compassion, understanding and inclusion and expect all community members to act in accordance to these values.

We have no tolerance for any form of harassment, we expect everyone to act professionally. Anyone identified as participating in harassing behavior will be approached by a staff member and asked to cease any inappropriate activity or to immediately disengage from our community. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to a person's identity.

* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices.

* Unwelcome physical contact.

* Threats of violence.

* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.

* Deliberate intimidation.

* Exclusionary jokes or comments.

* Unwelcome sexual attention

* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.

* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity.

* Sustained disruption of event programming.

Respect is important for everybody, if you feel uncomfortable, or suspect of someone's behavior, approach one of the organizers and staff members, we will handle it with confidentiality and care, witch-hunting and shaming other's actions is equally reprimandable.
