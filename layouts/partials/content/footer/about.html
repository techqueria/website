    need to thrive and become leaders in the tech industry.

    Founded in 2015, we are the largest community of Latinx professionals in tech in the U.S. with over 11,000 members and 7 chapters. Our online
    Slack community has 8,000+ members and 2,000+ weekly active users.

    The majority of our members work in PDE (product, design and engineering), have 3 to 5 years of experience, identify as millennials and joined
    Techqueria through word of mouth.

    We work with both tech companies and employee resource groups (ERGs) to build Latinx-centered spaces that revolve around career advice,
