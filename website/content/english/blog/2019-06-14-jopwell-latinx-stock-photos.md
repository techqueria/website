Last year, we embarked on a new initiative to increase representation in imagery through the development of The Jopwell Collection – original, free-to-download stock photography featuring diverse professionals in a wide array of work environments.

We’re proud to release the Jopwell Latinx Photo Collection Vol. I, a brand new collection featuring Latinx millennials in the workplace.

By providing free-to-download, high-quality images that highlight and celebrate Latinx professionals as their authentic professional selves, we hope to empower the next generation of leaders and showcase a way forward for true representation in the workplace.

Yet Latinxs only make up around 8% of media representation.

By providing free-to-download, high-quality images that highlight and celebrate Latinx professionals as their authentic professional selves, we hope to empower the next generation of leaders and showcase a way forward for true representation in the workplace."
