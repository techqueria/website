## Partnering

We're always looking for [partners and sponsors](/support-us/) to help move our mission forward! We can help promote your event to a Latinx audience, find volunteers for different activities, or design programs together that can benefit the community.

We are looking for speakers, locations for our events, those who can sponsors programs for our members, food, services, merchandise and we're open to other partnering ideas.

In return, we can provide a spotlight for your organization in our events and networks.

You can email us at [organizers@techqueria.org](mailto:organizers@techqueria.org), or use the contact form above to get in touch with us.

## Meet Us In Person

We usually host an event per month, so you are also welcome to connect with us at our various panels and talks in-person.

We also like to help other groups with their events and ideas.

Connect and share what you're working on with us!
