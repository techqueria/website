“UndocuHacks 2017” brought together professionals in the tech industry, community leaders, advocates, and others personally affected by immigration policies for 36 hours of consecutive hacking to develop digital tools for protection, education, and organizing. Roughly 40 young immigrants with DACA status from across the country convened in Los Angeles for the country’s first-ever immigrant youth-led hackathon, just days after President Trump decided to end the DACA program. The hackathon was sponsored by UndocuMedia, FWD.us, the Dream Resource Center at the UCLA Labor Center, the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California (LCHC), Mi Mentor, Techqueria, Codesmith, SUBB and Enplug.
