description: We started the Latin Tech Conference because the industry needed a space where the smartest, most diverse and ambitious LatinX people could connect and accelerate their potential. It’s needed more than ever, as the pace of tech jobs increase, and demand outstrips supply. The Latin Tech Conference is that space – where technology meets opportunity, opportunity meets companies, companies meet diversity and diversity becomes reality.
