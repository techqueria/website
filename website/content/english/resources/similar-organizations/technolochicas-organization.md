description: It is critical to acknowledge, celebrate, and raise visibility for Latinas in tech whose legacies and real-life stories inspire young women to pursue computing. TECHNOLOchicas is a necessary, focused approach that highlights the interests, strengths, and needs of Latinas. This campaign helps to show the Latino community that their daughters can achieve the same, or even greater, success in the technology industry. "She can’t be what she can’t see."
