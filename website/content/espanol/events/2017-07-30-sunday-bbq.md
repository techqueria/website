Join us for a day of music, food, and fun at John McLaren Park in San Francisco with fellow Techqueria members!

We will be grilling some meat and veggies. We want it to be a potluck style event, so if you have any food to share please bring some! Y si tienen musica tambien traiganla para bailar :D!

As per park regulations, no hard alcohol but beer and wine are welcome.

Our members work in all sorts of positions in tech companies, (from marketing to programming and more), as well as those who are interested in joining the field.

Though we have events in the Bay Area and LA, there are members across the globe; we also share events that take place nationwide, and are open to starting new local communities.
