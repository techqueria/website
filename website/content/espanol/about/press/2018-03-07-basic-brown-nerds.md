This week, Joy and Grecia talk about the Latinx NYC Meetup and disrupting the spaces on Broadway and Brunch. Along with their thoughts on John Leguizamo’s one-manshow “Latin History for Morons.” Touching about African erasure & homophobia in Latinx history and teaser to Juana Inez de La Cruz on Netflix. And what is peak wokeness? Are we ever woke enough? And how do we stop ourselves from being the woke-police (cause they really don’t wanna be the woke-police).
Oh and Fangirling to LatinosWhoLunch Podcast that created spaces for Latinx and inspired us to start!!!!

Shout out to everyone involved!
