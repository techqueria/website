# Code of Conduct

All participants of Techqueria are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct, both online and during in-person events that are hosted and/or associated with Techqueria.

We believe in respect, compassion, understanding, and inclusion and expect all community members to act on these values.

We have no tolerance for any form of harassment; we expect everyone to act professionally and to follow the social norms of the community.

### Alcohol

For all official Techqueria events, in instances where alcohol is present, the following is required:

- All attendees must have IDs checked to confirm they are 21+
- Alcohol consumption must be limited. Local chapters maintain autonomy for how to implement alcohol control measures (drink tickets, wristbands, etc)
- Additionally, it is at the local chapter’s discretion how to handle alcohol at casual events

## Reporting Violations

In the unfortunate case that you see someone violating the code of conduct, here are some ways that you can report it to us.

## Enforcement

All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. A staff member will approach anyone identified as participating in harassing behavior and asked to cease any inappropriate activity or to disengage from our community immediately.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

We hold the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Respect is essential for everybody so if you feel uncomfortable, or suspect of someone's behavior, approach one of the organizers and staff members, we will handle it with confidentiality and care.

Witch-hunting and shaming someone the actions of someone else is also in violation.
