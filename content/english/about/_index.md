## Who we are

Techqueria is a nonprofit that serves the largest community of Latinx in Tech. 🌮

We build Latinx-centered spaces that revolve around career advice, technical talks, mentorship, open jobs, upcoming events/conferences, speaking opportunities, and open-source. We come from all walks of life and believe that the diversity of our community is the most reliable asset we have.

Our space aims to be inclusive so we invite Latinx from the regions of the Caribbean, Haiti, and Brazil as well as those who identify as Afro-Latinx or LGBTQ. The term Latinx is used instead of Latino or Latina because it is a gender-neutral and inclusive term.

We have ~3,000 members in our Slack community, ~6,000 through our newsletter, supporters on Patreon, and thousands of followers on social media through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

The group began in Silicon Valley on November 15, 2015 and has since expanded to New York City, Austin, Los Angeles, and Chicago to connect and support Latinx professionals in those cities. We have also partnered with various organizations to sponsor our events and software such as 1Password, Dropbox, Uber, Stripe, Spotify, Digital Ocean, GitHub, and Google.

Ultimately, Techqueria's goal is to become the largest network for Latinx in tech professionals across the world.

## Our Story

David Silva and Shashi Jain organized the first event at NextSpace in Berkeley, CA.

We later started hosting at companies across the Bay Area and grew our community thanks to the work of Kimberly Muñoz and CJ Joulain.

LA was the first place we held events outside the Bay Area thanks to the help of Esteban Uribe and Hector Carmona.

As our community moves, we form chapters and support one another in building a home for Latinx in tech.

We welcome all that share our mission!
