If you are interested in supporting Techqueria as an individual, one great way to help out is by becoming a speaker for our events.

## As a speaker, you receive the opportunity to...

- improve your brand as we will be marketing your profile on our different social media platforms
- improve your public speaking skills with practice in front of large audiences (we typically get around ~250 people at our larger events)
- make new connections by letting the audience ask you questions after the talk
- receive swag or money for your efforts and time as a small token of our appreciation

We provide speakers a $50 reimbursement through our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/techqueria) for certain events. Please ask the event lead for confirmation.

## As a speaker you commit to...

- joining the appropriate event channel on Techqueria's [Slack](/slack) and responding when needed
- preparing in advance
- syncing with the event coordinators before your talk
- arriving to the event on time

## Interested in being a speaker?

If we have a need for speakers and you seem like a good fit for the event discussion, we'll reach out and send you more details!
