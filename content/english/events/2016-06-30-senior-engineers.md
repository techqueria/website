We invite you to a fireside chat with Latin@ senior engineers. It will be an informal discussion about their experiences with different technical languages/frameworks, as well as conversation on how they've navigated their careers. Whether you're just starting out in tech or wondering how to take the next step towards career advancement, the conversation will have something for everyone. We'll have plenty of time for Q and A.

All/allies welcome!

Panelists will include Victor Roman (Solar City), Kat Marchán (npm), and Adam Bossy-Mendoza (Patreon). Moderated by Kimberly Muñoz (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).

Bios:

Kat is a Puerto Rican software engineer currently with npm, Inc's CLI team. She's worked with a variety of languages, including Common Lisp, Erlang, and JavaScript, and is really interested in programming language theory and compilers. She's also an experienced web developer who specialized in both JavaScript-heavy SPA frontends and distributed server architectures. These days, aside from her npm CLI work, she enjoys making homecooked Puerto Rican food and flan, and helping manage the lgbtq.technology community for queer people in tech.

Adam is a Mexican-American engineering manager and entrepreneur currently at Patreon. He has been working in Silicon Valley for 8 years. He is passionate about class mobility, identity, self-education and personal fulfillment.
