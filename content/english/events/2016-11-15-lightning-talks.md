Join Techqueria on Tuesday, November 15 to celebrate our first anniversary!

In November, our event will showcase the talents of our membership. We'll start off with lightning tech talks on an assortment of topics, including presentations on overloading operators in Python (and an emoji-based script), Ada Lovelace, and the React framework.

Our speakers will include Jessica Earley, Patricia Arbona and Kevin Hernandez.

Then we'll discuss the history of Techqueria and break into discussion groups on how we can strengthen our community even more. We pride ourselves in being a peer mentorship network for Latinxs and other underrepresented groups in tech. We'd love your feedback on how we can improve and make bigger strides towards inclusion.

All, including allies, are welcome. The event is open to the public.

Food and light drinks will be provided.

Special thanks to our host, Hackbright Academy, for welcoming us into their space!
