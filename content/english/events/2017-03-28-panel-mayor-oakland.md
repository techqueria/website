You’re invited to an in-depth discussion with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf and executives from top local tech companies as you look at how tech companies can shed “unconscious biases” and look to diverse districts to expand their business and recruit new talent.

Then, join for a panel discussion featuring leaders from Yelp, Lever, Techqueria, and TechEquity Collaborative to discuss the process and challenges of building an inclusive employee base.

Networking, drinks, and appetizers will follow with representatives from local tech companies 99designs, Snagajob, Saildrone, and VSCO.
