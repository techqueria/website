This meeting is only for members of their company's Latinx ERG. If you identify as a Latinx in tech, you may request an invite to our Slack workspace using https://techqueria.org/slack and join the discussion there.

We're going to be in the 2nd floor. We will give the front desk a list of everyone that rsvp'ed. Let them know you're here to see Stephanie Cueto.

In this lunch we will be gathering with other Latinx ERGs to build community.

Feel free to message Shashi on Slack in the #ergs-bay-area channel if you have any questions, comments or concerns.

If you have a specific topic you'd like to discuss, please also share it to that same channel and we'll add it to the meeting notes - we want your voice to be heard!
