Join Techqueria for our latest event on Wednesday, September 28.

In September, our event will center on the field of Data Science. Often defined as a bridge between statistics and programming, Data Science can help improve procedures for solving a problem, though it also has its challenges. Our talks will explore recurring themes in machine learning, as well as their wider social implications.

Our speakers include Laura Gómez, CEO of Atipica and member of Project Include, and Luis Serrano, who leads the Machine Learning Nanodegree team at Udacity.

Food and soft drinks will be served. All, including allies, are welcome. The event is open to the public.

Schedule:

6:30 PM - 7:10 PM: Networking and light snacks

7:10 PM - 7:15 PM: Welcome to Lumosity by head of product Anthony Garcia (https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonymgarcia)

7:20 PM - 7:50 PM: Luis Serrano: "A Friendly Introduction to Machine Learning." Luis will give a brief, simple overview of the main algorithms in machine learning, and some of their applications. The main topics will be supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. No previous knowledge is required.

7:50 PM - 8:20 PM: Laura I. Gómez: "Data Science, Inclusion, & Accountability." Laura will be speaking about Data Science as it applies to her work with Atipica and Project Include. She will focus on the ways diversity builds product and algorithm accountability.

8:20 PM - 8:30: Q&A

8:30 PM - 9:00 PM : Networking & wrap up

Laura I. Gómez has worked in Silicon Valley in companies like Google (YouTube), SearchRev (acquired by AKQA) and Twitter.

She joined Twitter in 2009, where she was the first Latina employee and among the founding members of the international team member. She started solely responsible for the expansion of Twitter en español then moved on to lead international product and localization of Twitter into nearly 50 languages. Prior to leaving Twitter, Laura reported directly to the VP of International and Growth Product and managed a diverse team of product managers, project managers, language specialists, and support agents responsible for the majority of international initiatives such support, content, communications, market development and marketing. Laura was key in the implementation of unique community localization agile management of Twitter products: web, monetization, marketing microsites, product marketing materials, native clients, mobile web and SMS. Laura has appeared in dozens of publications as Harper's Bazaar Spain, GQ México, Gente México, La Nación, El Mercurio, Chile, El Universal México, El País in Spain and the book "Lost in Translation." Laura was recognized by the Department of State and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her involvement in the TechWomen Program. She is on the advisor board of Interesante, an interest-based network for U.S. Hispanic and Latin Americans.

Luis Serrano was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia. During high school, he was selected to represent his country in several international mathematical competitions, where he won several prizes, including a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad and a gold medal at the Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiad. He studied a bachelors and masters in mathematics at the University of Waterloo, in Canada, and a Ph.D in mathematics at the University of Michigan. At the conclusion of his PhD, he was selected by the National Science and Engineering Council of Canada as the top Canadian mathematics PhD student, and given a grant to pursue a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Quebec at Montreal. During this time, he taught university classes and wrote numerous publications in the areas of algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. It was then when he became heavily involved in the mathematical software Sage, and started to develop a passion for machine learning. In pursuit of this interest, he moved to Silicon Valley, where he spent two years at Google, applying machine learning algorithms to improve the video recommendations at YouTube. Wanting to combine his passion for education, mathematics, and machine learning, he moved to Udacity, one of the leading companies in online education, where he's the head of the Machine Learning Nanodegree team. Luis's dream is to bring the highest quality education to every human being in the planet, and he constantly strives towards this dream.
