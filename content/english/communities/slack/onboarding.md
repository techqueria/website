## Onboarding 🌺

We use Aloha & Donut for onboarding.

This way, folks get ramped up on Slack pretty quickly and the community is a whole lot more engaged and effective.

If you have feedback on onboarding, let us know in the `#meta` channel.

As part of onboarding, we'd love it if you uploaded a photo of yourself 🖼️ and completely filled out your profile on Slack. 📝

> You can include useful information in your profile like what your current role is, where you are based, your personal website, LinkedIn, Twitter or GitHub. 🧠
>
> And if it applies to you, there's even the option to showcase that you're job searching, willing to give a job referral or looking for mentors. 💼

Now that you've been using Slack for a little bit, *here are our top three recommendations*  :slack:

1. Fill out your profile completely so it's easier to distinguish you in a channel

https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile

2. Use threads for deeper discussions around specific topics or posts without clogging the rest of the channel 💬

https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-and-file-threads

3. When joining new channels, make sure to check the pinned items for useful information and tidbits 📌

_Here at Techqueria, we use tacos to lift each other up_ 💛

So whenever you'd like to add a little happiness to someone's day, just give them a taco and include a nice message, like this:

`@username your positive attitude was a real help today! :taco:`

> How HeyTaco works: https://www.heytaco.chat/how

1. Every person in our Slack can give up to 5 tacos per day 5️⃣
2. To give someone a taco, just add a taco emoji after their username 🌮
3. You can give tacos to anyone on your team as long as the bot has invited to the channel and if the bot isn't in the channel yet, you can use `/invite @heytaco` to invite it 🤖
4. There is a leaderboard (login with your Slack account) to see who is getting the most tacos at https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard 🏆
5. If you need help, you can just DM @heytaco the word `help` and it will assist you :hey-taco:

:blob-peek-a-boo:

_Make sure you uploaded a profile picture and filled out your profile_ 🖼️

Your profile photo helps us know who you are in Slack. If your photo is clear, it'll be easier for someone to pick you out in a crowd at a Techqueria event!

It's okay if you don't want to upload a photo of your face for privacy reasons. Just uploading any photo that defines you and differentiates you from others will really help - it can even be a sunflower. :sunflower:

_Handy Slack Reacjis (aka Emoji Reactions) & What They Mean_ :slack:

:thread: Please use threads next time

:frame_with_picture: Please upload a profile picture

:chill-out-with-the-posts: You should probably stop posting the same message so many times

:switch-to-a-different-channel: You are probably posting to the wrong channel

:eyes: I'm looking into this

:white_check_mark: This issue was resolved

:taco: You're awesome - have a taco

_Joined any new channels yet? Did you not find the one you wanted?_ :slack:

If you'd like to request a channel that doesn't already exist, check out #meta-request-channel ➕
