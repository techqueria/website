## Allies 💛

Techqueria is committed to bringing together and elevating Latinx professionals in the tech industry through a vibrant and supportive community. :taco:

However, it is not a requirement to identify as Latinx to be in this community which is why allies get access to 4 channels

1. `#announcements` to stay updated on latest updates from Techqueria leads
2. `#allies` to share resources and have discussions around allyship
3. `#jobs` to share job opportunities with the community
4. `#meta` to ask us any questions or provide feedback

The purpose of the `#allies` channel is for allies to share resources, events, etc with our community and to ask us any questions on how to partner up together or become a better ally. 🧠

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, let us know in #allies or #meta and a lead will get back to you.

With your support, Techqueria can become a stronger & more valuable community for Latinx in Tech. 💛

### Still want to join other channels?

We value you being a part of the community and your interest in being an ally!

To facilitate allyship, we are implementing best practices from other orgs that have been doing this type of work for a long time and adapting them to our organizational structure.

This organization exists as a space for **Latinx folks** to feel included in the Tech industry.

Generally allyship in underrepresented communities is there to support the community, not the other way around.

And so, while this structure is new for us as the community matures, we are firm in this policy.

We understand allyship is difficult (for everyone!), and we appreciate all the work you are putting in.

## Best Practices 🧠

### Use threads

This convo in the `#website` channel could have been 28 separate messages! 🤯

Instead, with threads - it turned into a more rich and focused discussion. 😌

![Threads](https://i.imgur.com/H9KWoqD.jpg)

### Refer to pinned posts

A lot of useful info is pinned to channels.

Make sure to check those out when joining a new channel. 📌

### Useful Reacjis

#### Notice someone posting the same message to 3+ different channels?

<img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0KQTUZ2B/chill-out-with-the-posts/a91d2e074b6b444f.png" class="u-box-shadow--none" alt="Chill out with the posts">

The `:chill-out-with-the-posts:` emoji will be used to indicate that whoever is posting the message needs to slow down with posting the same message to different channels and chill out with the posts.

We decided to create this emoji because sometimes we see the same person posting the same message to 3 (or 10) different channels in Slack.

This obviously comes across as a bit spammy and overly promotional so to encourage best behavior, all messages with `:chill-out-with-the-posts:` will go into the `#meta-chill-out` channel.

That way, if we see that the same person is continuously doing this, we can reach out to them directly.

#### Notice someone posting in the wrong channel?

<img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0KQTUZ2B/switch-to-a-different-channel/a37ccfaee5459a14.png" class="u-box-shadow--none" alt="Chill out with the posts">

The :switch-to-a-different-channel: will be used to indicate that someone is posting to the wrong channel and should probably switch to a different channel.

We will not be having a channel set up for this but it's just another we are letting folks in a friendly way that they should post their message somewhere else.

#### Notice someone not using threads effectively?

Use `:thread` to encourage people to use threads instead of posting in channel with a bunch of related messages

#### Notice someone who hasn't uploaded a profile picture?

Use `:frame_with_picture:` to encourage people to fill out their profile and upload a profile picture.

### HeyTaco

The [HeyTaco! bot](https://www.heytaco.chat) sparks conversations and builds stronger relationships with its fun and unique kindness currency... tacos! 🌮

You can use `@heytaco` to give someone a 🌮 when you'd like to show praise, appreciation, or to add a little happiness to their day.

1. Every person in our Slack Workspace has 5 tacos to give out per day
   5️⃣ 🌮
2. To give someone a taco, add a taco emoji after their username
   Like this: `@username your positive attitude was a real help today! :taco:`
   ![HeyTaco! Examples](/assets/img/slack/hey-taco-examples.png)
3. You can give tacos to anyone on your team as long as the bot has been invited to the channel
   You can invite the bot to channels using `/invite @heytaco`
4. There is a leaderboard to see who is getting the most tacos
   Anyone in our Slack Workspace can sign in and see the leaderboard using [https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard](https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard)
5. Need help?
   If you need help, you can just DM `@heytaco` the word `help` and it will assist you.

### Custom Status

Something fun we do in Techqueria's Slack is [setting a custom status](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability) with a flag representing our Latinx heritage/background.

![Custom Status Edit](/assets/img/slack/custom-status-edit.png)

You can find images for things like arepa, empanada, baseball teams, avocado, etc.

## Channels 💬

### Channel naming conventions

- Locations
  - `#locals-`
- Meta
  - `#meta-`
- Events
  - `#event-company-month-year`
- Organizers
  - `#organizers-`
- Partners
  - `#partner-`

### Default Channels

There are three default channels everyone automatically gets added to upon joining.

- `#announcements`
  - locked to the organizers - this is where admins/organizers will post news and information about the community at large
- `#jobs`
  - sharing and requesting job opportunities
- `#random`
  - conversations that don't fit in any topic channel but could be relevant for everyone

### Public Channels

We have created different channels to keep conversations relevant, for example:

- `#comida`
- `#front-end`
- `#futbol`
- `#javascript`
- `#memes`
- `#mentoring`
- `#musica`
- `#open-source`
- `#politica`

By default, you do not join those channels but you can click on _CHANNELS_ to see a list of all the channels and join the ones that seem the most interesting.

We monitor most activity in those channels to make sure content is relevant so if something off-topic is posted there, we might move it to a more appropriate channel.

### Location Based Channels

We have a few location channels that are prefixed with `#locals-`, for example:

- `#locals-atl`
- `#locals-austin`
- `#locals-boston`
- `#locals-chicago`
- `#locals-la`
- `#locals-nyc`
- `#locals-philly`
- `#locals-san-diego`
- `#locals-sf`

You can use these channels to communicate with folks in those locations, whether you live there or visiting it can be a great resource.

You can contact the admins to get new location channels created.

### Private Channels

We have a few private channels for conversations that you don't want everyone to see, and we're using a system created by [WeAllJs](https://wealljs.org) to manage the participation of those.

To see a list of available channels, run the command `/list-private`, and click on the join button to request an invitation.

![Private List](/assets/img/slack/private-list.png)

### Cafecito Channels

#### How Cafecito Channels Work

`@Buñuelo the Donut` pairs up people in cafecito channels every 2 weeks so they can get to know others in the Techqueria community. ☕

There are several cafecito channels in Techqueria - all based on location. If you'd like one added, head on over to #meta-request-channel.

- `#cafecito-sf`
- `#cafecito-nyc`
- `#cafecito-la`
- `#cafecito-chicago`
- `#cafecito-south-bay`
- `#cafecito-atx`
- `#cafecito-east-bay`

#### Setting up Cafecitos

For scheduling a time, we recommend setting up a Calendly account, connecting it to your both your personal and work calendars and then sharing the link - it's a real time saver! https://calendly.com

If you can't meet in person, we recommend using one of the following for video conferencing:

- built-in Slack calls https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack
- Daily https://www.daily.co
- Zoom https://zoom.us
- Google Hangouts https://hangouts.google.com

#### Leaving Cafecito Channels

1. Leave any of the `#cafecito-` channels you might have joined since this is where Buñuelo pairs you up with someone else from that channel
2. For any pairing you got in, there will be two meetup reminders messaged to you. Even if you leave the channel, you'll still get them so just expect those but if Buñuelo keeps persisting after that, contact an admin using `/admin`
3. Okay, good to go - no more messages from Buñuelo!

### Can I DM leads?

If you DM a lead, we may not be able to get to you in a very timely manner due to our limited bandwidth.

We love getting DMs from our members but we feel we're doing a disservice if it takes us more than a week to get back to you with your questions, feedback, concerns, etc.

Ergo, for any questions related to Slack, the website, volunteering, partnerships or really anything related to Techqueria — we ask that you please post in `#meta` to get a faster response.

For sensitive convos, please use the `/admin` command.

## Code of Conduct 🌻

You can find our code of conduct at [https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

In short, this is a professional community so be respectful of everyone and their identity.

Unprofessional behavior is **not** acceptable so if you feel that someone is breaking the code of conduct, make sure to contact an admin and we will sort it out.

You can contact an admin by using the command `/admin` in Slack followed by your message or you can reach out to us in `#meta`.
