Access to safe and equal-opportunity housing is a fundamental right, but in practice, LGBT members face larger obstacles in finding comfortable living situations.

The Nursing Home Abuse Center (NHAC) was founded on time-honored principles of restoring dignity for some of our most vulnerable and valuable citizens. Before we can begin to resolve the issue of nursing home abuse, we must understand what it is.

Our main focus is spreading awareness to LGBT seniors being mistreated and often abused in nursing homes and other support facilities.

There are approximately 3 million LGBT seniors over the age of 65, and this number is projected to double by 2030.

And sadly, as more LGBT community members come out, there are more abuse cases being reported especially within the senior community.

Of particular concern is housing discrimination, both in terms of access to housing and the treatment they receive once there.
