Within the Techqueria community, we provide different resources to help our members advance their careers, whether it is to find a new job, negotiate, practice for interviews or find new employees.

To join our Slack Workspace, you can request an invite to your email [on our Slack welcome page](/communities/slack/) and then you can participate with your smartphone or computer.

If you haven't used Slack before, take a look at these [Getting Started pages](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) where they explain how to take advantage of all the features.

In Slack, we have a channel titled `#jobs` that hosts all these discussions.
