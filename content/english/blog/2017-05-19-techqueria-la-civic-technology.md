On May 3rd Techqueria LA held an amazing meetup at [UrbanTXT](http://exploringtech.org/), an organization that inspires young men of color (7th-11th grade) to become developers and tech entrepreneurs. The setting was ideal as the focus of this event was civic technology. Community members, students of UrbanTXT as well as many new attendees were present.

We heard two excellent presentations that explored very different aspects of civic technology. Chris Cuellar who is a member of [Color Coded](http://colorcoded.la/) focused on how technology is not neutral and how to advance sustainable, community-centric projects for people of color of all identities. While [Juan Vasquez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansvas/) is a data and engagement strategist that works closely with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. He introduced us to the City of Los Angeles’ various data portals, highlighting ways to identify and explore datasets.
