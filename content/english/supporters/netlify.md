We currently use Netlify's [Open Source Plan](https://www.netlify.com/legal/open-source-policy/) but still pay for the usage of a feature called [Forms Level 1](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) which costs $19 per month or $228 per year.

We would also like to start getting access to the Netlify Analytics feature which costs $9 a month or $108 a year.

In total, sponsorship for Netlify would be $336 per year.
