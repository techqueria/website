On January 29th, we [announced Sentry’s Open Source Grant](https://blog.sentry.io/2019/01/29/apply-sentry-open-source-grant), and, quite frankly, we were pleasantly surprised by the applications we received. Thank you to everyone who applied — we sincerely appreciate the time and effort spent detailing your open source hopes and dreams. The passion demonstrated in these applications is what keeps the open source community innovative and, well, open.

## Now, the reason you’re reading this blog post…

Congratulations to [Frances Coronel](https://twitter.com/fvcproductions?lang=en), Open Source Lead at [Techqueria](https://techqueria.org/) and recipient of Sentry’s first-ever Open Source Grant! She has been working professionally as a developer since 2015 and has both a Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science. Her passions outside of work include contributing to open-source, public speaking and mentoring other URMs in tech. She has been involved with Techqueria as an open source lead since 2018.

As one of the largest Latinx professional communities in tech, Techqueria builds spaces around career advice and development as well as events, conferences, and speaking opportunities.

Techqueria is volunteer-run, and Sentry’s Open Source Grant will allow them breathing room to create a member portal that better engages their community through user profiles, job boards, and event calendars.

We’re excited about the targeted and thoughtful approach toward inclusion and community-building that Techqueria embodies in all of their projects.

## Honorable mentions
