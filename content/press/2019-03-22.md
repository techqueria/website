Congratulations to Sentry's Open Source Grant Recipient

Thank you to everyone who applied — we sincerely appreciate the time and effort spent detailing your open source hopes and dreams.

Congratulations to Frances Coronel, Open Source Lead at Techqueria and recipient of Sentry’s first-ever Open Source Grant! She has been working professionally as a developer since 2015 and has both a Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science. Her passions outside of work include contributing to open-source, public speaking and mentoring other URMs in tech. She has been involved with Techqueria as an open source lead since 2018.
