Join us for the 2nd annual Techstars Startup Weekend Latinx in Tech Philly!

We're gathering over 100 aspiring entrepreneurs, Latinx and allies, to identify and design technology solutions to problems disproportionately affecting the Latinx community. Startup Weekend is your chance to learn how to take any idea from concept to creation within a matter of days.

Participants pitch ideas Friday night and form teams, and work over the weekend with the help of business and tech mentors to create a minimum viable version of their idea, and present to investors Sunday night.
