Join us at DigitalOcean for an evening of sharing and networking to celebrate Hispanic Heritage month.

We'll have a panel of interesting tech professionals, telling us about their experience working as a Latinx in Tech, and the roads they traveled to get there, the opportunity to ask questions, enjoy food and drinks and network with other talented Latinx in Tech and DigitalOcean staff.
