I am currently a full stack software engineer with a passion for bringing diversity to the programming community. After spending a few years in tech on the marking and sales side of San Francisco based startups, and working in media at VICE in NY - while focusing on LatinX and Latin America growth
initiatives - I realized my passion really lied to make an impact within the Tech community. I wanted to help bridge the gap between the tech and LatinX worlds.

After attending the NYC Flatiron Full-stack Immersive program, I am now proud to say I am a full stack engineer at an Austin based startup, called Chipper. I am also an organizer for the Techqueria Austin Chapter and always looking to make tech more accessible to the LatinX community. I love helping
others find a passion for programming and finding inspiration in others!
