The violent and seditious attack at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, January 6, 2021 has triggered many of us. As a community, we recognize the significant role technology plays in society as well as its complications and degrees of complicitness in scaling hate speech to new levels of danger.

In response to the attack, Techqueria will postpone partner events over the next few weeks and take this time to reflect on how we can best advance our mission and commitment to supporting Latinx professionals in the tech industry.

In place of previously scheduled events, we plan on organizing safe spaces for our community members to reflect on last weekâ€™s attack. Techqueria will host a drop-in session on Thursday, January 14 from 2 pm to 3 pm PT // 5 pm to 6 pm ET to hear from the community on how to best support our members during this time. If you are unable to attend this session, we welcome your feedback at hola@techqueria.org

To promote additional healing, we are working with a licensed clinical professional to organize a session with our community in response to the attacks and the impact on our community. Event information will be shared as it develops.

Wishing you all physical and emotional well being during this time.
