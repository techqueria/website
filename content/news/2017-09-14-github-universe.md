With GitHub Universe one month away we are excited to announce our 2017 Community Partners!

We choose Community Partners based on several criteria but the three main questions we ask ourselves when reaching out to potential organizations are:

Does their work assist in lowering barriers for people from underrepresented backgrounds to enter and succeed in the tech industry? Do they have an audience that can benefit from complimentary tickets to the conference? Are they making a positive social impact, namely in the geographic region where
the conference will take place? GitHub’s push towards a more diverse, inclusive and accessible Universe is rooted in the fact that bringing together people from disparate backgrounds fosters innovation within our industry. If we’re not working to actively engage people from all walks of life, we’re
doing our community a disservice. The more we can bring diverse communities together, the more enriching, educational and valuable an experience we can provide for everyone.
